There are a few important point wrt. implementation of convos:
1) It was difficult to extract product and retailer names from user dialogue, so I have implemented a fix expression "I want <product name>" for products and "Tell me about <retailer name>" for retailers and links are generated using custom actions. These formats will be displayed when a user asks bot any of the above.
2) There is text asking the user to login to Mystore using their default browser so that cart viewing and order tracking can be done effectively.
3) Here is the link of google doc to mark the implementation of convos: https://docs.google.com/document/d/163__w__PjOBChlFTsFFw8Gi799COMtuk6hME9cUoeoQ/edit?usp=sharing
